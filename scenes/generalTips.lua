    Be aware of sharks while swimming. Although shark attacks are rare,  travellers should always be careful. Swim between the red and yellow flags and avoid swimming in dusk or evening and in deep water.

    Crocodiles must be considered in the northern areas of Australia. There are generally always multiple signs present advising travellers of a crocodile area but ask for expert advice before camping or fishing near a river, deep pool or mangrove. Never stay or camp in areas with crocodile tracks, especially close to the waterâ€™s edge.

    Australia is a large country with a highly urbanised population of approximately 24 million people, mostly clustered along the coast.

    Always carry a valid driving license and a translation if the license isn't in English.

    Do not interfere with the flora and fauna when staying in national parks. Penalties can apply for lighting fires, damaging bushland or trying to interact with the wildlife.

    Do not drive along the Nullabor or any other country roads between the hours of dusk and dawn as Kangaroos are known to jump across the road during these hours (this may cause car accidents).

    When crossing the border into other states make sure to check for certain food items that may not be allowed in other states (i.e. fruit from WA is not allowed to cross in to SA via car as it may attract certain fruit flies).

    Plan your drive in advance.
